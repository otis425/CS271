five topics related to computing (maybe an interesting looking data structure?!) that interest you, maybe even include a link to a page talking about the topic both in this README file and on the discord channel for this class,

five topics that you feel are difficult right now or topics that you think are generally difficult topics related to computer or computing,

submit the README into the assignment 0 submission spot on Moodle (this assignment page!)(we will take a look at these  README files again close to the end of the term!).
